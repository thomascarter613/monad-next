# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository purpose

**monad** is a polyglot monorepo orchestrator — one CLI that wraps every unit's native package manager (npm / pnpm / yarn / bun / cargo / go / composer / pip / bundle / mvn / gradle / deno) behind uniform verbs. Positioned as "built for agents first, first-class for humans."

**Language:** Rust (edition 2021, MSRV 1.75).

**Distribution:** published binaries via GitHub releases; floating minor tags (`v0.1`) and pinned patches (`v0.1.0`). GitHub Action at the repo root re-exports the CLI so CI users can `uses: thomascarter613/monad-next@v0.1`.

```

Agent-facing docs live in `docs/agents.md` — that's the user-visible guide for wiring Claude Code / Cursor / etc. into a monad-managed repo. Keep it current; it's the headline of the "built for agents" pitch.

## Quality gates

Every change must pass, before `git push` or a PR lands:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
```

The pre-push hook runs all three. Fast e2e tests are opt-out (skip ecosystems whose toolchain isn't on PATH); fat e2e tests need `MONAD_E2E_NETWORK=1` and all toolchains installed.

## Release workflow

1. Bump `workspace.package.version` + `workspace.dependencies` path refs + `monad-adapter-noop` dev-dep pin.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with post-last-tag commits.
3. Commit, tag `vX.Y.Z`, update floating `vX.Y` tag, push tags.
4. Release workflow builds + publishes prebuilt binaries automatically.

## Writing style

Concise and detailed. No fluff, no filler — get to the point but don't skip important detail. Follow existing `docs/*` patterns when adding documentation.

## Comments + commits

- Default to no comments. Add one only when the *why* is non-obvious (hidden constraint, subtle invariant, workaround rationale). Never comment the *what* — well-named identifiers cover that.
- Commit messages: lowercase, imperative, scope-prefixed (`fix(railway): …`, `test(e2e): …`). Body paragraphs explain the why + what changed, not the how.
- Keep commits atomic so bisect stays useful.

## Do not commit

- Generated binaries, `.env` files, `node_modules/`, target/release output.
