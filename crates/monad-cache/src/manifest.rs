//! [`InputManifest`] — a human-readable explainer for a cache key.
//!
//! Written to `<root>/<key>.inputs.json` alongside the tar bundle whenever a
//! task is cached. Read back by `monad why <hash>` to explain exactly what
//! went into the hash.
//!
//! Deliberately does NOT record env var *values* — those may be secrets.
//! Only the variable names are stored; the values live only in the cache
//! key itself.
